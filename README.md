# Monetary-Policy-Data-Library
This repository contains the code and documentation for the **Monetary Policy Data Library**, which compiles time series data on key monetary policy variables across numerous central banks and countries. Researchers in international finance, monetary economics, and political economy often lack centralized access to structured and cleaned data on global central bank policy decisions, balance sheet operations, and unconventional monetary tools. This project proposes the creation of a dedicated digital library designed to consolidate, standardize, and document publicly available but currently fragmented—data on historical decisions, balance sheets, policy operations, and forward guidance from major central banks. The platform aims to serve as a research-grade infrastructure layer that simplifies empirical work on monetary policy, while promoting accessibility and transparency in global macroeconomic research.

# Addressing The Problem
Over the past two decades, central bank operations and transparency have undergone a dramatic transformation, particularly in terms of publicly available data and the tools used to conduct monetary policy. The 21st-century adoption of additional policy tools such as quantitative easing (QE), forward guidance, and yield curve control (YCC) has spurred a surge in academic research within monetary economics. This growth in scholarship has, in turn, created greater demand for structured, comparable datasets to support empirical analysis. Yet, obtaining clean and harmonized data across central banks remains challenging. **The problem is twofold:** first, data are often siloed within the individual repositories of each central bank, with only limited attempts at consolidation; second, there is little consensus in event studies on which policy decisions or statements merit inclusion, leading to inconsistent datasets—such as mismatched timelines for QE announcements—across research papers _(see, for example, Lyonnet and Werner, 2012; Rosa, 2014; Filippo et al., 2022)_. Determining whether a given statement is likely to have a material and unexpected impact on markets is often subjective, and the lack of standardization forces researchers to compile event timelines and macro-financial datasets manually, drawing from PDF releases, institutional websites, or proprietary aggregators. The Monetary Policy Library addresses this gap by providing a curated, open-access repository of clean, structured, and comparable monetary policy data, designed specifically to support rigorous and reproducible research. 

Furthermore, the creation of such a data library would greatly assist researchers in compiling information for cross-country monetary policy studies. There is significant value in being able to quickly access a complete dataset of quantitative easing announcements—along with their associated details—made by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) since the Global Financial Crisis, without the need to manually trace each announcement from official communications on its website. This dataset could then be directly compared to similar collections from the Bank of England (BoE) or the European Central Bank (ECB) within the same structured framework. Several empirical event studies examining the impact of quantitative easing on asset prices have developed sets of policy announcements and their associated market effects, drawing either from prior research or their own compilations. The table below, for example, presents changes in interest rates for each date in the baseline event set, as well as for dates when the FOMC issued communications about LSAPs that conveyed little new information.

| 6/24/2009 | FOMC Statement                         | 10     | 6       | 4       | 4        | 4      | 6        | 5         |
| 8/12/2009 | FOMC Statement                         | -2     | 5       | 4       | 2        | 4      | 3        | 2         |
| 9/23/2009 | FOMC Statement                         | 1      | -3      | -1      | -1       | -5     | -5       | -4        |

By consolidating fragmented sources into a standardized, open-access repository, the Monetary Policy Library removes a major barrier to conducting timely, accurate, and comparable monetary policy research. Instead of spending days or weeks reconstructing event timelines from disparate documents, researchers can directly access clean datasets that are ready for empirical analysis and have been compiled through prior peer-reviewed research and publicly available Government data. This not only improves research efficiency, but also enhances reproducibility and cross-country comparability in monetary economics. In the following sections, we demonstrate how this approach works in practice and how it can be applied to real-world policy event studies.
